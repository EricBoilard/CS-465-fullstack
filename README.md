# CS-465-fullstack
Architecture

Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

  Using Express was a good way to connect HTML to static webpages that were used in the beginning of the project and using javascript I was able to take advantage of angular and node to also develope an SPA, or single page application to run the websites trips information. This SPA is better than running your average consumer facing html page because once the page intitially loads it only refreshes the page with data that is needed by the user. This increases load times and performance for the user and free's up some of the network for othe requests as users requests contain less information, creating less traffic.  

Functionality

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

Javascript is the glue that holds together most front end applications as it is the langauge that is most used in the web. JSON is javascripts object notation which is used to describe objects used in databases. JS and JSON can work together when JS is used to communciate with the web page and it needs to send data it does so with JSON data format. An example of when data was refactored to JSON was with the trips information. This allowed me to create the edit page within the web application and to send and retrieve trip data. 

Testing

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

Reflection

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

I feel that this course has helped me gain a better understanding of what a full stack application is along with what every individual part is reponsible for. This has helped me understand the purpose for many technologies and languages that I have always wondered about and has also opened my eyes to what it takes to create a full stack web application.
